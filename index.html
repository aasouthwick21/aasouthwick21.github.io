    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> 
        After graduating high school I honestly had no clue what I wanted to do. I bounced around for the next couple years working any job i could find from being a bouncer to selling cars.
        While I excelled at whatever my job was at the time I didn't have any passion for it, and then my dad got sick and my parents needed me to come back to family business, Southwick Linens.
        I did anything I could from selling and styling events like weddings and corporate dinners, setting up and tearing down events, and doing deliveries and pickups all over Arizona. In that time I learned I didn't want to take over the family business, but I did love helping the business and employees we had be the best we could be.</p>
        
        <p>As a student now I want to become a software engineer to help businesses develop to their fullest potential.</p>

        <p>If you want a developer with a passion to be the best in what they do then please reach out. I am excited to work with like minded developers and companies.</p>
